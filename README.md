# Planar
Planar is a three dimensional graph visualizer. Made using OpenGL. Features the ability to view multiple equations in both 3D and 2D with a high level of customizability.

<br />The 2D portion of $sin(x)+cos(y)$ shows the value range for all of the 3D portion of $sin(x)+cos(y)$.

<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x and y axis and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.

### $\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}$

<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x and y axis and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.

### $x^2 + y^2$
![x^2+y^2](https://github.com/Shivar-J/Planar/blob/main/GIFs/3DVisualizer_HfOYxPOexO.gif)
<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x an y axis (if you want to see the end change to $\[-10, 10\]$) and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.
