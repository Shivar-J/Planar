# Planar
Planar is a three dimensional graph visualizer. Made using OpenGL.

## $\sin(x) + \cos(x)$

<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x and y axis and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$. \textbf(Note) that the input expression was $x \sin + y \cos$ due to the current method functions are handled.

## $\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}$

<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x and y axis and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.

## $x^2 + y^2$
![x^2+y^2](https://github.com/Shivar-J/Planar/blob/main/GIFs/3DVisualizer_HfOYxPOexO.gif)
<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x an y axis (if you want to see the end change to $\[-10, 10\]$) and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.
