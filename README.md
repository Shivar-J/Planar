# Planar
Planar is a three dimensional graph visualizer. Made using OpenGL.

## Current state of Planar showcased susing $\sin(x) + \cos(x)$ and $x^2 + y^2$

<br />Current implementation allows for new equations to be generated and rendered from the window and adjustment of sample size.

## $\sin(x) + \cos(x)$

<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x and y axis and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$. 
<br />**Remark**, it is important to note that the input expression was $x \sin + y \cos$ due to the current method functions are handled.

## $\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}$
![(1/x)+(1/y)](https://github.com/Shivar-J/Planar/blob/main/GIFs/3DVisualizer_ScUhiq3K6R.gif)
<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x and y axis and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.

## $x^2 + y^2$
![x^2+y^2](https://github.com/Shivar-J/Planar/blob/main/GIFs/3DVisualizer_HfOYxPOexO.gif)
<br />From $\[-25, 25\]$ in both the x an y axis (if you want to see the end change to $\[-10, 10\]$) and a sample size of $1000 \cdot 1000$.
